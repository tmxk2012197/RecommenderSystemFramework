# Movie Recommender System

## Overview

Recommended movies to users based on the data from Netflix using 4 MapReduce Jobs in Linux environment.

## Building Steps

*	Built the user-rating matrix showing each userâ€™s rating for each movie. 
*	Built the co-occurrence matrix showing relationship among movies based on item-based collaborative filtering.

* $hadoop com.sun.tools.javac.Main *.java
* $jar cf recommender.jar *.class
* $hadoop jar recommender.jar Driver /input /dataDividedByUser /coOccurrenceMatrixGenerator /Normalize /Multiplication /Sum /RecommanderList
